# COTI V2 Confidential Smart Contracts | SDKs and Examples

All repositories specified below contain smart contracts that implement confidentiality features using the COTI V2 protocol.
The contracts provide examples for various use cases, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), ERC20 tokens, Auction, and Identity management.

These contracts demonstrate how to leverage the confidentiality features of the COTI V2 protocol to enhance privacy and security in decentralized applications.
The contracts are of Solidity and can be compiled and deployed using popular development tools like Hardhat and Foundry (Work in progress).

# COTI v2 Typescript SDK Examples

Examples that described above resides in [coti-sdk-typescript/src/examples], the solidity contracts are in the [confidentiality-contracts](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts) repo that is imported as a git submodule.

The following examples are available for **execution**:

| Contract       | Contract Description                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AccountOnboard | Onboard a EOA account - During onboard network creates AES unique for that EOA which is used for decrypting values sent back from the network |
| ERC20Example   | Confidential ERC20 - deploy and transfer encrypted amount of funds                                                                            |
| DataOnChain    | Basic encryption and decryption - Good place to start explorining network capabilties                                                         |

## Usage

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   yarn
   ```

2. Run ERC20 test

   ```
   yarn erc20
   ```


> [!NOTE]  
> Runnning tests will create an account automatically. The account will be saved to the `.env` file and will need to be funded. Use the COTI faucet to request devnet/testnet funds.


#### Pending enhancements

- Publishing SDK via npmjs
- Extending examples such as confidential ERC20 minting, confidential NFT (deployment and actions) and more.
